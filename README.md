# Traffic Predictor

A simple Python prototype for predicting traffic patterns using the Google Maps API. This project is designed for experimentation and learning, and demonstrates how to collect traffic data, test API connectivity, and lay the groundwork for future model training.

**Note:** The model is yet to be trained using a vast dataset. Current predictions are for demonstration only.

## Features
- Collects traffic data from Google Maps API
- Example usage and API testing scripts
- Modular code for easy extension

## Project Structure
- `traffic_prediction_prototype.py`: Main logic for data collection and prediction
- `example_usage.py`: Demonstrates how to use the system
- `test_api.py`: Tests Google Maps API connectivity
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
- `SETUP_GUIDE.md`: Step-by-step setup instructions

## Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```powershell
   python -m venv traffic_prediction_env
   .\traffic_prediction_env\Scripts\activate
